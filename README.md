# Disaster Tweet Classification

## Project Overview

This project aims to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to classify tweets as disaster-related or not. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and interpretation within the context of disaster response and emergency management.

## Project Goals

- Apply NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze tweet text.
- Train various machine learning models to classify tweets as disaster-related or not.
- Evaluate the performance of these models to find the most accurate one.
- Gain hands-on experience in data analysis, modeling, and interpretation within the context of NLP and machine learning.

## Steps

### 1. Data Acquisition
- Download the dataset from Kaggle (provide link) and explore its structure.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Clean the tweet text by removing noise such as special characters, URLs, and HTML tags.
- Normalize the text by converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, and applying stemming or lemmatization.
- Tokenize the text to convert sentences into individual words or tokens for further analysis.

### 3. Feature Extraction
- Employ TF-IDF or word embeddings (Word2Vec) to convert text data into a numerical format.
- Consider extracting additional features from the tweets, like tweet length or specific keywords.

### 4. Model Training and Selection
- Train different machine learning models (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).
- Use cross-validation to optimize model parameters and prevent overfitting.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- Visualize evaluation results using plots (confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.).

### 6. Interpretation and Application
- Choose the best-performing model and discuss its strengths and potential applications.
- Explore real-time disaster monitoring and information dissemination through social media integration.

### 7. Documentation and Presentation
- Document the entire project process, methodologies, model choices, and evaluation outcomes.
- Prepare a summary of findings, model performance, and potential impact on disaster response strategies.
